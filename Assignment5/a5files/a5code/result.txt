1. Discuss the process you use to build your best classifier.
    a)What feature(s) did you try?
        We have tried bounding box area and box height/width ratio besides curvature.
    b)Were they continuous or discrete?
        In our implementation, box area and curvature are continuous and box height/
        width ratio is discrete.
    c)How did you determine thresholds for discrete features?
        We used featureTest() to collect data and plotted a histogram and set the
        thresholds according to the distribution of the histogram.
    d)How well did it work?
        In general, the correct percentage increases when adding a new feature, but
        sometimes it drops slightly. A more detailed analysis is presented below.

2. Choose a set of training files and a set of test files (for this assignment it's
   OK if the sets overlap). Give the confusion matrix that results from running the
   naive (basic) classifier and the confusion matrix that results from running your
   best classifier.

    Training and testing on whole data set:
    1. basic classifier
        confusion matrix:
        {'text': {'text': 407, 'drawing': 334}, 'drawing': {'text': 392, 'drawing': 882}}
    2. best classifier
        confusion matrix:
        {'text': {'text': 650, 'drawing': 91}, 'drawing': {'text': 467, 'drawing': 807}}
    After adding 3 features (curvature, box area, box height/width ratio) to our basic
    classifier, the accuracy of text increases from 0.549 to 0.877 while the accuracy of
    drawing decreases slightly from 0.692 to 0.633. Therefore, we could conclude that the
    features performs exordinaryly on text class, but may not be as good to drawing class.
